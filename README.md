# TF_MKDCNet for polyp segmentation
Unofficial tensorflow code implementation of paper "Automatic Polyp Segmentation with Multiple Kernel Dilated Convolution Network".

Paper link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.06264v2.pdf

Offical pytorch code implementation: https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/MKDCNet

I implemented the tf version code according to the official pytorch code as much as possible.

My tensorflow version: 2.8.0
